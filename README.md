<p>Developed for Boyce Astro in San Diego, CA for double star astronomy research. The tool is designed to simplify 
the target selection process and give preliminary analysis of candidates.</p> 

<p>The web application was developed using Python Flask and Pandas. Pandas was used to emulate SQL-like functionality. The dataset was also prepared and validated using Pandas</p>

<p>Most of the application is located in the "tool" directory. The main runtime script is located in "routes.py".</p>

<p>The dataset is an enhanced version of a database made by Dave Rowe. The original dataset comes from the 
Washington Double Star Catalog that is maintained by the US Naval Observatory. The additional data comes the GAIA DR2, 
an analysis done by Richard Harshaw, and work done by Alex Hewett. </p>
